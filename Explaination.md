This script implements a chatbot-like system using a pre-trained language model (tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct) from Hugging Face Transformers.
torch: Utilized for handling tensors and enabling the use of the GPU for computations.
transformers: A library by Hugging Face to interact with pre-trained models.
model: The pre-trained instruction-tuned model tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct is used, optimized for generating coherent and instruction-based responses.
AutoTokenizer: Handles tokenization (splitting text into tokens) for the specific model.
pipeline: Creates a pipeline for text generation using the specified model and tokenizer.
torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16: Uses bfloat16 precision for faster computations on compatible GPUs.
device_map="auto": Automatically maps the model to available GPUs/CPUs.
trust_remote_code=True: Enables trust in model-specific code hosted remotely.
prompt: The initial question or topic of discussion.
newline_token: Encodes the newline character (\n) to retrieve its token ID. This is used to identify where the response should stop.
my_name and your_name: Define the names for the simulated conversation.
dialog: Maintains the history of the conversation between "Alice" (the user) and "Bob" (the chatbot).
max_length=500: Limits the length of the generated response.
do_sample=True: Enables sampling from the probability distribution for more diverse responses.
top_k=10: Considers the top 10 most likely tokens during sampling.
num_return_sequences=1: Only one response is generated per prompt.
return_full_text=False: Returns only the generated response, excluding the input prompt.
eos_token_id=newline_token: Stops generation when a newline character (\n) is encountered.
pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id: Uses the end-of-sequence token as a padding token for uniform length.
The modelâ€™s response (sequences[0]['generated_text']) is printed to the console.
The response is added to the dialog history as a line spoken by Bob.
